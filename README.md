# physician_compare
Exploratory data analysis on Medicare providers using Spark. 

# Project Overview
This project uses a dataset that contains performance information on hospitals and doctors participating in a Merit-Based Incentive Payment System (MIPS) in the United States. Physician Compare is part of Medicare, the American federal health insurance program for people who are 65 years or older. According to the Medicare website, Physician Compare “helps you find and compare clinicians and groups enrolled in Medicare so that you can make informed choices about your healthcare.” Because Spark is such a powerful processing engine, it is the best choice for conducting my analysis. As a physical wellbeing specialist, I am consistently looking into healthcare data. To find a dataset, I went to Kaggle.com and filtered for medium-sized datasets with the keyword, “healthcare.” When I stumbled upon the “Physician Compare” datasets, I was intrigued. These yearly datasets are an inside look into the performance of hospitals and Medicare providers across the United States.
